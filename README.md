## Roadmap 📌
- **Full Linux and MacOS support**
- **Better lyrics consistency** (some songs still don't have them)
- **Artist Pages** with monthly listeners, playlists and popular songs alongside streams amount feature when clicking on the artist name, also integrate into the search results so that one can find artists
- **Liked songs** playlist support
- **Discord RCP** is coming
- **App Auto-Update** so that you don't manually have to check for changes
- Maximize Button + An option for Windows-style window controls
- Start App on boot option
- Raycast support with app specific URLs
- Fix Windows media player controls sometimes not working
- **Music Video** support
- Add to startup option
- Space to pause sometimes selects elements instead of pausing / resuming
- Cap Too long Song names and make them smoothly move vertically

## Platform Support 💻

- **Windows** is the primary supported platform.
- **macOS** does not work at this point but will soon
- **Linux** support is in the working. This should take a few days until it's implemented! 
### MacOs Issues
**MacOs may prompt you with a Keychain popup asking for permission.** The app stores one encryption key in its own Keychain entry. Your YouTube Music session is encrypted with that key before it is saved in the app data directory.

If you do not need signing into YouTube Music you dont need to grant Keychain permissions. If you do it is recommended to click "always allow" in the popup to prevent MacOs from being annoying 

## Legal
**This project DOES NOT offer any downloading functionality. This is a client providing Theme and Decorative additions for audio listening only.**

**If anyone from Google reads this:** There was no official client, I just wanted a good desktop client. Thats why I made this, please don't sue me!
