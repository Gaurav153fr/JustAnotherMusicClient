## Roadmap 📌
- **Better lyrics consistency** (some songs still don't have them)
- **Artist Pages** with monthly listeners, playlists and popular songs alongside streams amount feature when clicking on the artist name, also integrate into the search results so that one can find artists
- **Liked songs** playlist support
- Fix Windows media player controls sometimes not working
- **Music Video** support

- Space to pause sometimes selects elements instead of pausing / resuming
- Cap Too long Song names and make them smoothly move vertically

## Platform Support 💻

- **Windows** is the primary supported platform.
- **macOS** support is experimental and may have incomplete features or platform-specific issues.
- **Linux** honestly haven't tried it. Should work if you compile it from source? If someone tries let me know!
### MacOs Issues
**MacOs may prompt you with a Keychain popup asking for permission.** The app stores one encryption key in its own Keychain entry. Your YouTube Music session is encrypted with that key before it is saved in the app data directory.

If you do not need signing into YouTube Music you dont need to grant Keychain permissions. If you do it is recommended to click "always allow" in the popup to prevent MacOs from being annoying 

## Third-Party Services
